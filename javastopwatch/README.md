# Overview

In making this assighnment im trying to understand java enough to start a real project. 

Im taking a stopwatch and turning it into a timer. Im writing that becouse it seems like a great first step to programming in a language right after "hello_world.java"

# Development Environment

I made this in intellij. That's another thing new I tried out.

Java, the programming language im learning, is a lot more difficult to learn than python was. I reccomend starting with somthing a bit easier for your first time programming. that being said, with some help from some friends i was able to figure it out and get the hang of it.

# Future Work


* I want the timer to actually do something when it hits 0 rather than just roll into negative numbers
* I want to try using java for a real task like making an app.
* Another task I can do with java is mod minecraft.
